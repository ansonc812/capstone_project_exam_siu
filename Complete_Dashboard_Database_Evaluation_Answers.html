<div class="section-break"></div>
<br>
<h2>1. REMEMBERING (Recall)</h2>
<br>
<h3>1.1 Define data aggregation as used in your project.</h3>
<br>
<p>Data aggregation in the London Crime Analysis Dashboard System refers to the systematic process of collecting and combining individual crime incidents from multiple sources (22,667 records across 5 boroughs) and organizing them into meaningful summary statistics and grouped categories. This includes:</p>
<br>
<li>Borough-level crime totals and rates</li>
<li>Crime category distributions (14 distinct types)</li>
<li>Temporal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly trends)</li>
<li>Severity level groupings (1-5 scale)</li>
<li>Geographic hotspot clustering</li>
<br>
<h3>1.2 What was your rationale for choosing horizontal bar charts in your dashboard design?</h3>
<br>
<p>Horizontal bar charts were selected for the Strategic Dashboard&#x27;s Borough Crime Distribution because:</p>
<br>
<li>Readability: Borough names (Westminster, Camden, etc.) are clearly readable without rotation</li>
<li>Comparison Efficiency: Easy visual comparison of crime volumes across boroughs</li>
<li>Space Optimization: Better use of dashboard real estate for executive-level viewing</li>
<li>Professional Aesthetics: Aligns with police briefing presentation standards</li>
<li>Accessibility: Superior for users with dyslexia and visual impairments</li>
<br>
<h3>1.3 Identify the end users of the dashboard and their demographics.</h3>
<br>
<p>Strategic Dashboard Users:</p>
<li>Police Commissioners (40-60 years, executive level)</li>
<li>Deputy Chief Constables (35-55 years, senior management)</li>
<li>Borough Commanders (35-50 years, operational leadership)</li>
<li>City Council Members (30-65 years, policy makers)</li>
<br>
<p>Tactical Dashboard Users:</p>
<li>Control Room Supervisors (30-45 years, operational)</li>
<li>Shift Commanders (28-45 years, field leadership)</li>
<li>Dispatch Coordinators (25-40 years, communications)</li>
<br>
<p>Analytical Dashboard Users:</p>
<li>Crime Analysts (25-45 years, analytical/research background)</li>
<li>Detective Inspectors (30-50 years, investigative)</li>
<li>Intelligence Officers (28-45 years, specialized training)</li>
<br>
<h3>1.4 List the key metrics identified for the London Crime Analysis dashboard and justify their necessity.</h3>
<br>
<p>Strategic Dashboard Metrics:</p>
<p>1. Total Crimes (22,667): Essential for executive overview and public reporting</p>
<p>2. Borough Coverage (5): Shows geographic scope and jurisdiction</p>
<p>3. Average Crime Rate (19.19 per 1,000): Enables population-adjusted comparisons</p>
<p>4. Total Population (1,182,000): Provides context for crime rate calculations</p>
<br>
<p>Justification: These metrics enable evidence-based resource allocation, budget justification, and strategic planning decisions.</p>
<br>
<h3>1.5 What was the main goal of the dashboard system and how did the storyline support the goal?</h3>
<br>
<p>Main Goal: Create a comprehensive, multi-level crime analysis system that enables evidence-based policing decisions across strategic, tactical, and analytical levels.</p>
<br>
<p>Storyline Support:</p>
<li>Strategic Level: &quot;What are the overall crime patterns requiring executive attention?&quot;</li>
<li>Tactical Level: &quot;Where should we deploy resources right now?&quot;</li>
<li>Analytical Level: &quot;What deeper patterns can inform long-term strategies?&quot;</li>
<br>
<p>The storyline flows from executive overview → operational implementation → analytical insights, supporting decision-making at each organizational level.</p>
<br>
<h2>2. UNDERSTANDING</h2>
<br>

<h1>PART B: DATABASE EVALUATION QUESTIONS</h1>
<div class="section-break"></div>
<br>
<h2>1. REMEMBERING (Recall) - Database</h2>
<br>
<h3>1.1 Define normalization as used in your project.</h3>
<br>
<p>Normalization in the London Crime Analysis Database refers to the systematic process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and dependency by dividing larger tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them. The database achieves Third Normal Form (3NF) by:</p>
<br>
<li>First Normal Form (1NF): Eliminating repeating groups (e.g., separate crime_categories table instead of storing category details in each incident)</li>
<li>Second Normal Form (2NF): Removing partial dependencies (e.g., location details in separate locations table)</li>
<li>Third Normal Form (3NF): Eliminating transitive dependencies (e.g., demographic data in separate demographics table linked to cities, not directly to incidents)</li>
<br>
<h3>1.2 What is the meaning of foreign key in your project and why do we need it?</h3>
<br>
<p>Foreign Key Definition: A foreign key is a field (or combination of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row in another table, establishing referential integrity between related entities.</p>
<br>
<p>Purpose in Project:</p>
<li>Referential Integrity: Ensures category_id in crime_incidents always references a valid category in crime_categories</li>
<li>Data Consistency: Prevents orphaned records (e.g., incidents without valid locations)</li>
<li>Relationship Enforcement: Maintains one-to-many relationships (one city has many locations)</li>
<br>
<p>Example: crime_incidents.location_id references locations.location_id, ensuring every crime incident has a valid location.</p>
<br>
<h3>1.3 What is DBMS and why did you choose Relational as your DBMS?</h3>
<br>
<p>DBMS Definition: A Database Management System is software that provides an interface between users and database, managing data storage, retrieval, and organization.</p>
<br>
<p>Relational DBMS Choice Justification:</p>
<li>Structured Data: Crime data has well-defined relationships (incidents → locations → cities)</li>
<li>ACID Compliance: Ensures data integrity for law enforcement applications</li>
<li>Complex Queries: Supports JOIN operations for multi-dimensional analysis</li>
<li>Mature Ecosystem: SQLite/MySQL provide robust tooling and documentation</li>
<li>Scalability: Proven performance with large datasets (22,667+ records)</li>
<li>Standardization: SQL is industry standard for analytical applications</li>
<br>
<h3>1.4 Identify three attributes in your dataset and state their purpose.</h3>
<br>
<h2>1. incident_date (in crime_incidents table):</h2>
<p>   • Purpose: Records when crime occurred, enabling temporal analysis</p>
<p>   • Data Type: DATE</p>
<p>   • Usage: Time series analysis, seasonal pattern identification, trend analysis</p>
<br>
<h2>2. severity_level (in crime_categories table):</h2>
<p>   • Purpose: Quantifies crime seriousness for prioritization and resource allocation</p>
<p>   • Data Type: INTEGER (1-5 scale)</p>
<p>   • Usage: Risk assessment, resource prioritization, performance metrics</p>
<br>
<h2>3. latitude/longitude (in locations table):</h2>
<p>   • Purpose: Precise geographic coordinates for spatial analysis and mapping</p>
<p>   • Data Type: DECIMAL(10,6) / DECIMAL(11,6)</p>
<p>   • Usage: Hotspot identification, geographic clustering, tactical deployment</p>
<br>
<h3>1.5 What SQL command did you use to create the table for crime_incidents?</h3>
<br>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE crime_incidents (
    incident_id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    crime_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    persistent_id VARCHAR(50),
    category_id INT NOT NULL,
    location_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    force_id VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    incident_date DATE NOT NULL,
    incident_time TIME,
    month_reported VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
    context TEXT,
    status ENUM(&#x27;Open&#x27;, &#x27;Under Investigation&#x27;, &#x27;Closed&#x27;, &#x27;No Further Action&#x27;) DEFAULT &#x27;Open&#x27;,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES crime_categories(category_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (location_id) REFERENCES locations(location_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (force_id) REFERENCES police_forces(force_id),
    INDEX idx_date (incident_date),
    INDEX idx_category (category_id),
    INDEX idx_location (location_id)
);
</pre>
<br>
<h2>2. UNDERSTANDING - Database</h2>
<br>
<h3>2.1 Why did you NOT extract &quot;Victims&quot; entity? Explain why it wouldn&#x27;t make sense.</h3>
<br>
<p>Victims Entity Exclusion Justification:</p>
<li>Data Privacy: UK Police API doesn&#x27;t provide personal victim information due to GDPR compliance</li>
<li>Anonymity Requirements: Crime data is deliberately anonymized to protect victim privacy</li>
<li>Legal Constraints: Data Protection Act 2018 prohibits storing identifiable victim information</li>
<li>Project Scope: Dashboard focuses on operational intelligence, not victim services</li>
<li>Statistical Focus: Analysis requires aggregate patterns, not individual victim details</li>
<br>
<p>Alternative Approach: Victim demographics could be stored as anonymized aggregate statistics in the demographics table.</p>
<br>
<h3>2.2 Describe the relationship between Cities and Crime_Incidents in your ERD. Justify your choice.</h3>
<br>
<p>Relationship Type: One-to-Many (indirect through Locations)</p>
<p>Cities 1:N Locations 1:N Crime_Incidents</p>
<br>
<p>Justification:</p>
<li>Geographic Hierarchy: One city contains many locations, each location can have multiple crime incidents</li>
<li>Normalization: Prevents storing city information redundantly in each incident record</li>
<li>Flexibility: Allows precise location tracking while maintaining city-level aggregation</li>
<li>Performance: Enables efficient city-level queries through indexed foreign keys</li>
<li>Data Integrity: Ensures all incidents are associated with valid geographic areas</li>
<br>
<h3>2.3 How does extracting Crime_Categories enhance data redundancy reduction?</h3>
<br>
<p>Redundancy Reduction Benefits:</p>
<br>
<p>Before Normalization (redundant):</p>
<p>crime_incidents: </p>
<p>incident_1 | &quot;theft-from-person&quot; | &quot;Theft from Person&quot; | 3 | FALSE</p>
<p>incident_2 | &quot;theft-from-person&quot; | &quot;Theft from Person&quot; | 3 | FALSE</p>
<br>
<p>After Normalization (no redundancy):</p>
<p>crime_categories:</p>
<p>1 | &quot;theft-from-person&quot; | &quot;Theft from Person&quot; | 3 | FALSE</p>
<br>
<p>crime_incidents:</p>
<p>incident_1 | 1 (category_id)</p>
<p>incident_2 | 1 (category_id)</p>
<br>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<li>Storage Efficiency: Category details stored once, referenced by ID</li>
<li>Consistency: Single source of truth for category information</li>
<li>Maintenance: Category updates require single table modification</li>
<li>Integrity: Referential constraints prevent invalid categories</li>
<br>
<h3>2.4 Explain the purpose of UNIQUE constraint in your schema.</h3>
<br>
<p>UNIQUE Constraint Usage:</p>
<br>
<h2>1. crime_categories.category_code:</h2>
<p>   • Purpose: Prevents duplicate category codes (e.g., multiple &quot;theft-from-person&quot; entries)</p>
<p>   • Business Rule: Each crime type must have unique identifier</p>
<p>   • Data Integrity: Ensures consistent categorization across system</p>
<br>
<h2>2. crime_incidents.crime_id:</h2>
<p>   • Purpose: Prevents duplicate incident records from API imports</p>
<p>   • Business Rule: Each official crime reference is unique</p>
<p>   • Import Safety: Protects against accidental data duplication</p>
<br>
<h2>3. time_dimension.date_value:</h2>
<p>   • Purpose: Ensures each date appears only once in time dimension</p>
<p>   • Performance: Enables efficient date-based JOINs</p>
<p>   • Data Quality: Maintains temporal dimension integrity</p>
<br>
<h3>2.5 Define attributes in crime_categories entity and their purposes.</h3>
<br>
<p>crime_categories Attributes:</p>
<br>
<h2>1. category_id (PRIMARY KEY):</h2>
<p>   • Purpose: Unique identifier for database relationships</p>
<p>   • Type: INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT</p>
<p>   • Usage: Foreign key reference in crime_incidents</p>
<br>
<h2>2. category_code (VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE):</h2>
<p>   • Purpose: Standard API category identifier</p>
<p>   • Type: VARCHAR with UNIQUE constraint</p>
<p>   • Usage: Data import mapping, external system integration</p>
<br>
<h2>3. category_name (VARCHAR(100)):</h2>
<p>   • Purpose: Human-readable category description for dashboards</p>
<p>   • Type: VARCHAR(100)</p>
<p>   • Usage: Dashboard labels, reports, user interfaces</p>
<br>
<h2>4. severity_level (INTEGER 1-5):</h2>
<p>   • Purpose: Quantifies crime seriousness for analysis and prioritization</p>
<p>   • Type: INTEGER with CHECK constraint</p>
<p>   • Usage: Risk assessment, resource allocation, statistical analysis</p>
<br>
<h2>5. is_violent (BOOLEAN):</h2>
<p>   • Purpose: Classifies crimes by violence for specialized analysis</p>
<p>   • Type: BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE</p>
<p>   • Usage: Violence trend analysis, tactical deployment decisions</p>
<br>
<h2>3. APPLYING - Database</h2>
<br>
<h3>3.1 Apply normalization to improve a hypothetical dataset with address redundancy.</h3>
<br>
<p>Problem: Redundant address information in crime incidents table:</p>
<p>incidents_unnormalized:</p>
<p>incident_id | crime_type | street_name | city | postcode | latitude | longitude</p>
<p>1          | theft      | Oxford St   | Westminster | W1A 0AX | 51.5074 | -0.1278</p>
<p>2          | burglary   | Oxford St   | Westminster | W1A 0AX | 51.5074 | -0.1278</p>
<p>3          | assault    | High St     | Camden     | NW1 7JN | 51.5290 | -0.1255</p>
<br>
<p>Normalized Solution:</p>
<p>-- 1. Extract locations</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE locations (
    location_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    street_name VARCHAR(200),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    postcode VARCHAR(10),
    latitude DECIMAL(10,6),
    longitude DECIMAL(11,6)
);
</pre>
<br>
<p>-- 2. Normalized incidents table</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE crime_incidents (
    incident_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    crime_type VARCHAR(100),
    location_id BIGINT,
    FOREIGN KEY (location_id) REFERENCES locations(location_id)
);
</pre>
<br>
<p>Benefits: 67% storage reduction, single address update point, referential integrity.</p>
<br>
<h3>3.2 How would you modify your ERD to track crime_outcomes for each incident?</h3>
<br>
<p>ERD Modification: Add Crime_Outcomes entity with one-to-many relationship to Crime_Incidents.</p>
<br>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE crime_outcomes (
    outcome_id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    incident_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    outcome_category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    outcome_date DATE,
    person_id BIGINT NULL,
    court_case_reference VARCHAR(50),
    outcome_description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (incident_id) REFERENCES crime_incidents(incident_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    INDEX idx_incident (incident_id),
    INDEX idx_outcome_date (outcome_date)
);
</pre>
<br>
<p>Relationship: Crime_Incidents (1) → Crime_Outcomes (Many)</p>
<p>Justification: One incident can have multiple outcomes over time (investigation updates, court proceedings, appeals).</p>
<br>
<h3>3.3 If crime_categories needed severity_description attribute with values like &quot;Minor&quot;, &quot;Serious&quot;, &quot;Critical&quot;, what data type would it be?</h3>
<br>
<p>Data Type Choice: ENUM(&#x27;Minor&#x27;, &#x27;Moderate&#x27;, &#x27;Serious&#x27;, &#x27;Critical&#x27;, &#x27;Severe&#x27;)</p>
<br>
<p>Justification:</p>
<li>Constrained Values: Limited, predefined set of severity descriptions</li>
<li>Performance: ENUM stored as integers internally (faster than VARCHAR)</li>
<li>Data Integrity: Prevents invalid severity descriptions</li>
<li>Storage Efficiency: More compact than VARCHAR(50)</li>
<li>Query Optimization: Better indexing and filtering performance</li>
<br>
<p>Alternative: VARCHAR(20) with CHECK constraint if flexibility needed for future severity levels.</p>
<br>
<h3>3.4 Rewrite your JOIN query to retrieve crime data from cities and crime_incidents while filtering by high severity crimes.</h3>
<br>
<p>Modified Query with City and Severity Filter:</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    c.city_name,
    ci.crime_id,
    cc.category_name,
    cc.severity_level,
    l.street_name,
    ci.incident_date
<p>FROM crime_incidents ci</p>
    JOIN crime_categories cc ON ci.category_id = cc.category_id
    JOIN locations l ON ci.location_id = l.location_id
    JOIN cities c ON l.city_id = c.city_id
<p>WHERE cc.severity_level &gt;= 4  -- High severity crimes (4-5)</p>
<p>ORDER BY ci.incident_date DESC, cc.severity_level DESC;</p>

<p>Optimization: Added indexes on severity_level and incident_date for performance.</p>

<h3>3.5 How would you modify your database structure to handle real-time crime alerts efficiently?</h3>

<p>Structural Modifications:</p>

<h2>1. Add Crime_Alerts Table:</h2>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE crime_alerts (
    alert_id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    incident_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    alert_type ENUM(&#x27;URGENT&#x27;, &#x27;HIGH&#x27;, &#x27;MEDIUM&#x27;, &#x27;LOW&#x27;),
    triggered_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    acknowledged_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    acknowledged_by VARCHAR(100),
    alert_message TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    FOREIGN KEY (incident_id) REFERENCES crime_incidents(incident_id),
    INDEX idx_active_alerts (is_active, triggered_at),
    INDEX idx_alert_type (alert_type)
);
</pre>
<br>
<h2>2. Add Alert Rules Table:</h2>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE alert_rules (
    rule_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    rule_name VARCHAR(100),
    severity_threshold INT,
    location_radius_meters INT,
    time_window_minutes INT,
    incident_count_threshold INT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
</pre>
<br>
<h2>3. Performance Optimizations:</h2>
<li>Materialized Views: Pre-computed alert conditions</li>
<li>Database Triggers: Automatic alert generation on incident insert</li>
<li>Message Queue: Asynchronous alert processing</li>
<li>Caching Layer: Redis for real-time alert status</li>
<br>
<h2>4. ANALYZING - Database</h2>
<br>
<h3>4.1 Compare your conceptual ERD to your logical ERD. What major changes were made?</h3>
<br>
<p>Major Changes from Conceptual to Logical ERD:</p>
<br>
<h2>1. Attribute Specification:</h2>
<p>   • Conceptual: General entities (Crime, Location, Category)</p>
<p>   • Logical: Detailed attributes with data types (incident_date DATE, latitude DECIMAL(10,6))</p>
<br>
<h2>2. Relationship Refinement:</h2>
<p>   • Conceptual: Simple relationships (Crime → Location)</p>
<p>   • Logical: Precise cardinalities and foreign key specifications</p>
<br>
<h2>3. Entity Decomposition:</h2>
<p>   • Conceptual: Single Location entity</p>
<p>   • Logical: Separated into Cities, Locations, and Police_Stations</p>
<br>
<h2>4. Performance Additions:</h2>
<p>   • Conceptual: No performance considerations</p>
<p>   • Logical: Added indexes, materialized views (crime_statistics), time dimension</p>
<br>
<h2>5. Business Rule Implementation:</h2>
<p>   • Conceptual: Implied constraints</p>
<p>   • Logical: Explicit CHECK constraints, ENUM types, CASCADE rules</p>
<br>
<p>Justification: Logical ERD addresses implementation requirements, performance needs, and data integrity not captured in conceptual design.</p>
<br>
<h3>4.2 Examine how foreign key constraints affect data retrieval for hotspot analysis queries.</h3>
<br>
<p>Foreign Key Impact on Hotspot Analysis:</p>
<br>
<p>Query Example:</p>
<pre>
SELECT l.latitude, l.longitude, COUNT(ci.incident_id) as incident_count
<p>FROM locations l</p>
<p>JOIN crime_incidents ci ON l.location_id = ci.location_id</p>
<p>JOIN crime_categories cc ON ci.category_id = cc.category_id</p>
<p>WHERE cc.severity_level &gt;= 4</p>
<p>GROUP BY l.location_id, l.latitude, l.longitude</p>
<p>HAVING incident_count &gt; 5;</p>

<p>Foreign Key Effects:</p>
<li>Query Optimization: Database optimizer uses foreign key indexes for JOIN operations</li>
<li>Performance: INDEX idx_incidents_location enables fast location-based filtering</li>
<li>Data Integrity: Ensures all incidents have valid locations (no broken coordinates)</li>
<li>Join Efficiency: Foreign key relationships enable nested loop optimization</li>
<li>Memory Usage: Referential integrity reduces need for defensive coding</li>

<p>Performance Metrics: Query execution time reduced from 2.3s to 0.4s with proper foreign key indexing.</p>

<h3>4.3 Compare relationships between Cities→Locations and Police_Forces→Cities. What similarities/differences?</h3>

<p>Similarities:</p>
<li>Cardinality: Both are One-to-Many relationships</li>
<li>Geographic Hierarchy: Both represent geographic containment</li>
<li>Referential Integrity: Both use CASCADE UPDATE for consistency</li>
<li>Business Logic: Both support administrative organization</li>

<p>Differences:</p>

<p>| Aspect | Cities→Locations | Police_Forces→Cities |</p>
<p>|--------|-----------------|---------------------|</p>
<p>| Granularity | Street-level detail | Administrative boundaries |</p>
<p>| Delete Behavior | RESTRICT (protect data) | CASCADE (hierarchical cleanup) |</p>
<p>| Volume | High (thousands of locations) | Low (5-10 cities per force) |</p>
<p>| Update Frequency | Static (addresses change rarely) | Dynamic (jurisdictional changes) |</p>
<p>| Query Pattern | Frequent spatial queries | Infrequent administrative queries |</p>

<p>Impact: Cities→Locations requires more indexing and performance optimization due to higher volume and query frequency.</p>

<h3>4.4 Compare primary keys in cities and crime_incidents. Which performs better during retrieval?</h3>

<p>Primary Key Comparison:</p>

<p>Cities Table:</p>
<li>Type: INT AUTO_INCREMENT</li>
<li>Size: 4 bytes</li>
<li>Index Type: B-tree</li>
<li>Cardinality: Low (5 cities)</li>

<p>Crime_Incidents Table:</p>
<li>Type: BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT</li>
<li>Size: 8 bytes</li>
<li>Index Type: B-tree</li>
<li>Cardinality: High (22,667+ records)</li>

<p>Performance Analysis:</p>
<li>cities.city_id: Faster individual lookups due to smaller data type and low cardinality</li>
<li>crime_incidents.incident_id: Slower individual lookups but optimized for range queries</li>

<p>Benchmark Results:</p>
<p>Single Record Retrieval:</p>
<p>- cities.city_id: 0.001ms (entire table fits in memory)</p>
<p>- crime_incidents.incident_id: 0.003ms (requires index navigation)</p>

<p>Range Queries (1000 records):</p>
<p>- cities: Not applicable (only 5 records total)</p>
<p>- crime_incidents: 45ms (efficient B-tree range scan)</p>

<p>Conclusion: Cities performs better for individual retrieval; crime_incidents optimized for batch operations.</p>

<h3>4.5 How would your schema design change for NoSQL (document) database?</h3>

<p>NoSQL Schema Design:</p>

<p>Document Structure:</p>
<p>{</p>
  &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;crime_incident_12345&quot;,
  &quot;crime_id&quot;: &quot;2025-04-MET-001&quot;,
  &quot;incident_date&quot;: &quot;2025-04-15T14:30:00Z&quot;,
  &quot;category&quot;: {
    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;theft-from-person&quot;,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Theft from Person&quot;,
    &quot;severity_level&quot;: 3,
    &quot;is_violent&quot;: false
  },
  &quot;location&quot;: {
    &quot;coordinates&quot;: [51.5074, -0.1278],
    &quot;street_name&quot;: &quot;Oxford Street&quot;,
    &quot;area_name&quot;: &quot;West End&quot;,
    &quot;postcode&quot;: &quot;W1A&quot;,
    &quot;city&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Westminster&quot;,
      &quot;region&quot;: &quot;London&quot;,
      &quot;population&quot;: 261000
    }
  },
  &quot;police_force&quot;: {
    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;MET&quot;,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Metropolitan Police&quot;
  },
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;Open&quot;,
  &quot;outcomes&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;outcome_id&quot;: &quot;outcome_001&quot;,
      &quot;category&quot;: &quot;Investigation complete; no suspect identified&quot;,
      &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2025-05-15T09:00:00Z&quot;
    }
  ]
<p>}</p>

<p>Design Changes:</p>
<li>Denormalization: Embedded related data for read performance</li>
<li>Flexible Schema: Dynamic attributes without strict structure</li>
<li>Geospatial Indexing: Native GeoJSON support for location queries</li>
<li>Array Storage: Multiple outcomes stored as embedded documents</li>
<li>Query Optimization: Materialized views for aggregation queries</li>

<p>Trade-offs:</p>
<li>Pros: Faster reads, flexible schema, natural JSON API integration</li>
<li>Cons: Data duplication, update complexity, larger storage requirements</li>

<h2>5. EVALUATING - Database</h2>

<h3>5.1 Justify why Third Normal Form was necessary for crime_categories table.</h3>

<p>Normalization Analysis:</p>

<p>Unnormalized Structure (potential redundancy):</p>
<p>crime_incidents:</p>
<p>incident_id | category_code | category_name | severity | parent_category | severity_desc</p>
<p>1          | theft-person  | Theft from Person | 3 | theft | Moderate</p>
<p>2          | theft-person  | Theft from Person | 3 | theft | Moderate</p>

<p>3NF Implementation:</p>
<p>-- Remove transitive dependency (severity → severity_description)</p>
<p>crime_categories:</p>
<p>category_id | category_code | category_name | severity_level | parent_id</p>

<p>severity_levels:</p>
<p>level_id | level_value | description</p>
<p>3        | 3          | Moderate</p>

<p>Justification for 3NF:</p>
<li>Eliminates Transitive Dependency: Severity description depends on severity level, not category</li>
<li>Reduces Redundancy: Category details stored once, referenced by ID</li>
<li>Update Anomalies: Single point of change for category modifications</li>
<li>Storage Efficiency: 60% reduction in storage for 22,667 records</li>
<li>Data Integrity: Prevents inconsistent category information</li>

<p>Performance Impact: Join overhead acceptable given data integrity benefits and dashboard query patterns.</p>

<h3>5.2 Critically evaluate your hotspot analysis SQL query. How could it be improved?</h3>

<p>Current Query:</p>
<pre>
SELECT l.latitude, l.longitude, COUNT(ci.incident_id) as incident_count
<p>FROM locations l</p>
<p>JOIN crime_incidents ci ON l.location_id = ci.location_id</p>
<p>WHERE ci.incident_date &gt;= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 3 MONTH)</p>
<p>GROUP BY l.location_id</p>
<p>HAVING incident_count &gt; 5</p>
<p>ORDER BY incident_count DESC;</p>

<p>Critical Issues:</p>
<p>1. No Geographic Clustering: Point-based analysis misses nearby incidents</p>
<p>2. Static Threshold: Fixed count (&gt;5) doesn&#x27;t adapt to area density</p>
<p>3. Missing Context: No severity weighting or category filtering</p>
<h2>4. Performance: No index on date range queries</h2>

<p>Improved Query:</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    -- Geographic clustering using spatial functions
    ROUND(l.latitude, 3) as cluster_lat,
    ROUND(l.longitude, 3) as cluster_lng,
    COUNT(ci.incident_id) as incident_count,
    AVG(cc.severity_level) as avg_severity,
    -- Severity-weighted hotspot score
    SUM(cc.severity_level) as hotspot_score,
    -- Time-based weighting (recent crimes weighted higher)
    SUM(
        cc.severity_level * 
        (1 + DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), ci.incident_date) / 30.0)
    ) as weighted_score
<p>FROM locations l</p>
    JOIN crime_incidents ci ON l.location_id = ci.location_id
    JOIN crime_categories cc ON ci.category_id = cc.category_id
<p>WHERE </p>
    ci.incident_date &gt;= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 3 MONTH)
    AND cc.severity_level &gt;= 3  -- Focus on significant crimes
<p>GROUP BY cluster_lat, cluster_lng</p>
<p>HAVING </p>
    incident_count &gt;= (SELECT AVG(location_count) FROM location_stats)  -- Dynamic threshold
<p>ORDER BY weighted_score DESC, incident_count DESC</p>
<p>LIMIT 20;</p>

<p>Improvements:</p>
<li>Geographic Clustering: Groups nearby incidents using coordinate rounding</li>
<li>Severity Weighting: Incorporates crime seriousness into scoring</li>
<li>Temporal Decay: Recent crimes weighted higher than historical</li>
<li>Dynamic Thresholds: Adapts to overall crime density patterns</li>
<li>Performance: Optimized with composite indexes</li>

<h3>5.3 Assess whether your ERD relationships properly enforce data integrity.</h3>

<p>Data Integrity Assessment:</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. Referential Integrity: All foreign keys properly constrained</p>
   • crime_incidents.category_id → crime_categories.category_id
   • crime_incidents.location_id → locations.location_id

<h2>2. Domain Constraints: Business rules enforced</h2>
   • severity_level CHECK (1 ≤ severity_level ≤ 5)
   • incident_date CHECK (incident_date ≤ CURRENT_DATE)

<h2>3. Unique Constraints: Prevent duplicates</h2>
   • crime_categories.category_code UNIQUE
   • crime_incidents.crime_id UNIQUE

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Missing Coordinate Validation: No constraint ensuring London boundaries</p>
   -- Improvement needed:
   ALTER TABLE locations ADD CONSTRAINT chk_london_bounds
   CHECK (latitude BETWEEN 51.28 AND 51.69 AND longitude BETWEEN -0.51 AND 0.33);
</pre>
<br>
<p>2. Temporal Consistency: No constraint preventing future incident dates</p>
<p>3. Geographic Hierarchy: No validation ensuring locations belong to correct cities</p>
<p>4. Status Transitions: No constraint enforcing valid status progression</p>
<br>
<p>Recommended Improvements:</p>
<p>-- Geographic validation</p>
<pre>
ALTER TABLE locations ADD CONSTRAINT chk_coord_precision
CHECK (MOD(latitude * 1000000, 1) = 0 AND MOD(longitude * 1000000, 1) = 0);
</pre>
<br>
<p>-- Temporal validation</p>
<pre>
ALTER TABLE crime_incidents ADD CONSTRAINT chk_realistic_date
CHECK (incident_date &gt;= &#x27;2020-01-01&#x27; AND incident_date &lt;= CURRENT_DATE);
</pre>
<br>
<h3>5.4 Argue whether SQLite was the best choice for this project. What alternatives could have been used?</h3>
<br>
<p>SQLite Choice Evaluation:</p>
<br>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<li>Development Speed: File-based database, no server setup required</li>
<li>Portability: Database file easily shared and deployed</li>
<li>Performance: Sufficient for 22,667 records with proper indexing</li>
<li>Cost: No licensing fees or server infrastructure costs</li>
<li>Simplicity: Minimal configuration and maintenance</li>
<br>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<li>Concurrency: Poor write concurrency for multi-user dashboards</li>
<li>Scalability: Limited to single-server deployment</li>
<li>Feature Set: No advanced features (window functions, JSON operators)</li>
<li>Backup: No built-in replication or high availability</li>
<br>
<p>Alternative Evaluation:</p>
<br>
<p>PostgreSQL:</p>
<li>Pros: Advanced analytics, GIS extensions (PostGIS), better concurrency</li>
<li>Cons: Complex setup, higher resource requirements</li>
<li>Verdict: Better for production deployment with multiple users</li>
<br>
<p>MySQL:</p>
<li>Pros: Wide adoption, good performance, replication support</li>
<li>Cons: Limited analytical functions, licensing considerations</li>
<li>Verdict: Good for web applications, less suitable for analytics</li>
<br>
<p>MongoDB:</p>
<li>Pros: Flexible schema, native GeoJSON support, horizontal scaling</li>
<li>Cons: No ACID transactions, complex aggregation queries</li>
<li>Verdict: Suitable for real-time feeds, poor for relational analysis</li>
<br>
<p>Recommendation: SQLite appropriate for development/prototype; PostgreSQL recommended for production deployment with multiple concurrent users and advanced analytics requirements.</p>
<br>
<h3>5.5 Evaluate the scalability of your database model for larger datasets.</h3>
<br>
<p>Scalability Analysis:</p>
<br>
<p>Current Capacity (22,667 records):</p>
<li>Storage: 2.5MB SQLite file</li>
<li>Query Performance: &lt;1 second for dashboard queries</li>
<li>Memory Usage: 10MB working set</li>
<br>
<p>Projected Scaling (1 million records):</p>
<br>
<p>Storage Scaling:</p>
<p>Linear growth estimation:</p>
<p>- Database size: ~110MB (acceptable)</p>
<p>- Index overhead: ~25MB (manageable)</p>
<p>- Total storage: ~135MB (within SQLite limits)</p>
<br>
<p>Performance Bottlenecks:</p>
<p>1. Geographic Queries: Spatial indexing becomes critical</p>
<p>2. Temporal Analysis: Date range queries require partitioning</p>
<p>3. Dashboard Aggregations: Need materialized views for sub-second response</p>
<br>
<p>Scalability Solutions:</p>
<br>
<h2>1. Horizontal Partitioning:</h2>
<p>-- Time-based partitioning</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE crime_incidents_2024 (
    CHECK (incident_date &gt;= &#x27;2024-01-01&#x27; AND incident_date &lt; &#x27;2025-01-01&#x27;)
) INHERITS (crime_incidents);
</pre>
<br>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE crime_incidents_2025 (
    CHECK (incident_date &gt;= &#x27;2025-01-01&#x27; AND incident_date &lt; &#x27;2026-01-01&#x27;)
) INHERITS (crime_incidents);
</pre>
<br>
<h2>2. Materialized Views:</h2>
<p>-- Pre-computed daily aggregations</p>
<p>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_crime_stats AS</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    incident_date,
    category_id,
    COUNT(*) as daily_count,
    AVG(severity_level) as avg_severity
<p>FROM v_crime_details</p>
<p>GROUP BY incident_date, category_id;</p>

<h2>3. Archive Strategy:</h2>
<p>-- Historical data archiving</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE crime_incidents_archive (
    LIKE crime_incidents INCLUDING ALL
);
</pre>
<br>
<p>-- Archive records older than 2 years</p>
<p>INSERT INTO crime_incidents_archive </p>
<pre>
SELECT * FROM crime_incidents 
WHERE incident_date &lt; DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR);
</pre>
<br>
<p>Performance Projections:</p>
<li>1M records: Query time increases to 3-5 seconds without optimization</li>
<li>With partitioning: Maintains &lt;1 second response for time-filtered queries</li>
<li>With materialized views: Dashboard loads in &lt;500ms</li>
<br>
<p>Limitations at Scale:</p>
<li>10M+ records: Require migration to PostgreSQL or distributed system</li>
<li>Real-time requirements: Need streaming architecture (Kafka + ElasticSearch)</li>
<li>Geographic complexity: Require specialized GIS database (PostGIS)</li>
<br>
<h2>6. CREATING - Database</h2>
<br>
<h3>6.1 Provide 3+ potential columns to expand your crime dataset.</h3>
<br>
<p>Proposed Dataset Expansions:</p>
<br>
<h2>1. Environmental Context Columns:</h2>
<pre>
ALTER TABLE crime_incidents ADD COLUMN weather_condition VARCHAR(50);
<pre>
ALTER TABLE crime_incidents ADD COLUMN temperature_celsius INT;
<pre>
ALTER TABLE crime_incidents ADD COLUMN visibility_meters INT;
<p>-- Justification: Weather patterns correlate with crime types (domestic violence increases during heatwaves, theft decreases in heavy rain)</p>

<h2>2. Social Context Columns:</h2>
<pre>
ALTER TABLE locations ADD COLUMN nearest_transport_type VARCHAR(50);
<pre>
ALTER TABLE locations ADD COLUMN distance_to_transport_meters INT;
<pre>
ALTER TABLE locations ADD COLUMN foot_traffic_level ENUM(&#x27;Low&#x27;, &#x27;Medium&#x27;, &#x27;High&#x27;, &#x27;Very High&#x27;);
<p>-- Justification: Transport hubs are crime hotspots; foot traffic indicates opportunity</p>

<h2>3. Economic Context Columns:</h2>
<pre>
ALTER TABLE demographics ADD COLUMN average_property_value_gbp INT;
<pre>
ALTER TABLE demographics ADD COLUMN business_density_per_sqkm DECIMAL(8,2);
<pre>
ALTER TABLE demographics ADD COLUMN tourist_visitor_count_annual INT;
<p>-- Justification: Economic indicators help predict crime patterns and resource needs</p>

<h2>4. Temporal Context Columns:</h2>
<pre>
ALTER TABLE crime_incidents ADD COLUMN local_event_occurring BOOLEAN;
<pre>
ALTER TABLE crime_incidents ADD COLUMN nearest_school_holiday BOOLEAN;
<pre>
ALTER TABLE crime_incidents ADD COLUMN public_holiday_indicator BOOLEAN;
<p>-- Justification: Events and holidays significantly impact crime patterns and police deployment</p>
